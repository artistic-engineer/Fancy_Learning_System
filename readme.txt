This project is one of Shakespeare literature Learning System's UI part using HTML/CSS/Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap.
The design of UI is full of fancy, which is the reason of its name. However, the most important reason is that it's my
girlfriend's name. I am willing to use this name for every of my own project.
